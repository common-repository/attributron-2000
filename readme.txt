== Description ==

This plugin adds attribution inputs to the media uploader and "edit media" page. It includes a number of creative common license, public domain, fair use, and standard copyright. It will link back to the author's page at either the end of a post/page and/or the attachment page. If you have a Flickr API key, it can automatically pull information for Flickr images (copyright, author name, title, description, etc).
It adds a few settings to the Media settings page.  You can add a Flickr API key, or display Creative Common logos for their respective licenses.

To style the attributions, I've added these CSS classes:

* a2k-container - A div that contains all of the other elements
* a2k-sources - Contains the text "Source:" or "Sources:" depending on the context
* a2k-title - The attachment title
* a2k-copyright - The copyright information.  It may or may not contain an img tag, depending on your settings
* a2k-author - The author information.  If an author link is provded, it will contain an a tag.
